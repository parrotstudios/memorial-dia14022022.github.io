    <h1>14/02/22 - 14:50 </h1><br>
<p>Yesterday I visited the big waterfall, saw Micka and said goodbye for the night, this morning after the gym I cried to the bucket kkk like a young boy when he loses his bird, I deactivated all my social networks and also said goodbye to Késia. I looked at some old photo albums, I realized that memories are getting lost with time.</p> <br>
    <p>Here I write my few memories that were also lost over time. many questions i have, but one of them i can answer right here and now, yes i loved and still love that girl from five years ago. </p> <br>
    <p>Today I decided to write here in my memories no longer a diary as it was</p><br>
    <p>For those of you who read this, Forgive me for being so sad and hopeless I feel alone, and the emptiness fills me all over now I've lost everything I've lost everyone for trying to be someone, in search of love I... I found dark eyes That asked me for help, love, help me</p>
    <p>I never had the courage, never had. Despite being intense, I fuck myself intensely, I dove into the sea of ​​roses and drowned in the Thorns of loneliness until my dog ​​despises me. (What a joke)</p>
    <p>I found myself in the heat of the rain, and that in the hot breeze I saw you, my old habit of being pathetic did, not the wind, not the cold but made me take you away from me myself.</p><br >
    <p>My tired, exhausted heart, <br>
don't care about commas <br>

      I put the full stop at the beginning <br>

      and more than one, more than two, <br>

      three, <br>

      I lost myself in you.</p><br>
    <p> Countless countless pages I hid you, I missed them, I put myself in them. </p>

    <p>Lightning and thunder always scared me because most of the time I was alone when they came suddenly</p>

    <p>I remember the last time I saw her, I didn't want to see her like that.</p>

<p>That look of hers, that way she always looked at me.</p>

    <p>For her I was hope, such a hope that I turned into a ghost, which does not act and is dead.</p>

    <p>I'll never forget your look I wanted to help you, I needed you but I'm not that strong Knight on a white horse you deserve.</p>

    <p>I didn't want to make you cry or disturb your life but in this attempt I managed to do the opposite</p> <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>I keep thinking about going back and showing you this, but I'm afraid it's too late..., it's going to get dark I miss you.</p>
