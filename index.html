    <h1>14/02/22 - 14:50 </h1><br>
   <p> yesterday I visited big waterfall, saw Micka and said goodbye for the night, this morning after the gym I cried my eyes out kkk just like young boy when he loses his bird, deactivated all my social networks and also said goodbye to Késia. looked at some old photo albums, realized that memories are getting lost with time.  </p> <br>
    <p> Here I write my few memories that have also been lost with time. many questions I have, but one of them I can answer here and now, yes I loved and still love that girl from five years ago. </p> <br>
    <p>Today I decided to write here in my memoirs no longer a diary as it was being </p><br>
    <p>for you who read this, Forgive me for being so sad and hopeless I feel alone, and emptiness fills me completely now I have lost everything I have lost everyone for trying to be someone, in search of love I... I found dark eyes That asked me for Help, love, help me </p>
    <p> I never had the courage, never had it. Though I'm intense, I iron myself intensely, I plunged into the sea of roses and drowned in the Thorns of loneliness even my dog despises me. (What a joke) </p>
    <p>I discovered myself in the heat of the rain, and that in the warm breeze I saw you, my old habit of being pathetic made, not the wind, not the cold but made myself carry you away from me. </p><br>

<p> My tired, exhausted heart, <br>

      don't care about commas <br>

      I put the full stop at the beginning <br>

      and more than one, more than two, <br>

      three, <br>

      I lost myself in you. </p> <br>
    
<p> Countless countless pages I hid you, I missed them, I put myself in them. </p>

    <p>Lightning and thunder always scared me because most of the time I was alone when they came suddenly</p>

    <p>I remember the last time I saw her, I didn't want to see her like that.</p>

    <p>That look of hers, that way she always looked at me.</p>

   <p>For her I was hope, such a hope that I turned into a ghost, which does not act and is dead.</p>

    <p>I'll never forget your look I wanted to help you, I needed you but I'm not that strong Knight on a white horse you deserve.</p>

    <p>I didn't want to make you cry or disturb your life but in this attempt I managed to do the opposite</p> <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
<p>I keep thinking about going back and showing you this, but I'm afraid it's too late..., it's going to get dark I miss you.</p>
